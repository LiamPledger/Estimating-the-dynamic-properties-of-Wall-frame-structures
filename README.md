# Estimating-the-dynamic-properties-of-Wall-frame-structures
This repository includes additional data, python scripts, and files used in the journal paper "Estimating the dynamic properties of wall-frame structures". The data is available for all to download and use.

A MathCAD file is also available for users. The MathCAD file provides a worked example of the procedure outlined in the paper. The values obtained from the approximate method can also be compared against the estimated period and mode-shape from the Wall-frame structural model developed in OpenSees. MathCAD software can be downloaded at the following link : https://www.mathcad.com/en. A PDF version of the MathCAD file is available as well.
